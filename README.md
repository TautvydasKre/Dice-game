# Dice Game

## Objective:
The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach or exceed a score of **50 points**.

## Game Setup:
- The game starts by asking for the number of players, which must be between **2 and 4**.
- Each player starts with a score of **0**.

## Gameplay:
- Players take turns rolling a virtual die (with values between **1 and 6**).
- On each turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly until they either:
  1. **Choose to stop** and add their turn's total to their overall score.
  2. **Roll a 1**, which ends their turn with no points added for that round.
- The player must decide whether to roll again (risking a roll of 1) or "bank" the points earned so far during their turn.

## Rules:
- **Rolling a 1:** If a player rolls a 1, their turn immediately ends, and they earn **0 points** for that round.
- **Rolling 2-6:** The player adds the rolled value to their score for that turn.
- Players can continue rolling for as long as they want during their turn, as long as they don't roll a 1.

## Ending the Game:
- The game continues until one player's total score reaches or exceeds **50 points**.
- Once that happens, the player with the highest score is declared the winner.

## Example:
- If a player rolls a **1** on their first roll, they lose their turn with **0 points** added.
- If a player rolls a **4**, they can choose to roll again or stop and add 4 to their total score.

## Winning:
- The game finishes when a playerâ€™s total score equals or exceeds **50**.
- The player with the highest score at that point wins, and the game announces the winner.

This game involves **strategic risk-taking**, where players must decide when to stop rolling and secure their points or risk losing them by rolling a 1.
